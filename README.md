# g3n1us_elementary
A super-simple frontend framework for 90% of your projects.

Most frameworks do everything, but most of the time our projects leave a lot of leftovers. If you grit your teeth every time you see a Wordpress site with only a few pages, this is for you. 

Elementary is intended to enforce the fundamentals, while turbo charging your dev team. It intends to stay simple, while allowing your team to stay productive.
